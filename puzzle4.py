# Regular expressions are extremely helpful in extracting useful information from loads of text.
# Regular expressions work on pattern-matching techniques. Extracting phone-number, validating passwords,
# and extracting images from web-pages are but a few examples of regex usage.

# In this question, we'll learn the use of Regex in Python.
# You will be provided a string str in which you have to find all the numbers and print them.

# Note: In Python, you need to import re module to use regex

import re


def numberMatcher(str):
    pat = r"\d+"
    # find all finds all the matched texts and returns a list
    match = re.findall(pat, str)
    if (match):
        for i in match:
            print(i, end=" ")
    else:
        print(-1, end="")
